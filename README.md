### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, wanted an application designed to help students pass their driving tests, with features enabling studentst to set up appointments with instructors and view their progress on various online practice exams they can take to assist in their studies.

### What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I clear grasp aon what the users, both administrative and student, would need, with respect to it being a driving based system with appointments that need to be set, but also resources and support for students to use. I tried to consider the way in which I would like my own student platforms to operate as well.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would most likely go back through my diagrams and just expand on them a little more. A lot of the processes involved in the application design were fairly simple, but there being a lot of relationships between variables, I think a more clear and specific picture of the overall relationships would better provide clarification for anyone who may view them in the future.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Each user need gave me an idea of the simple approach to be taken for each feature and process involved. "The user should be able to schedule a driving test appointment." would then be broken down into whichever respective process was necessary, such as assigning user variables to specific appointment times and dates, with specific instructors. It's important to understand what the user needs, why they need it, and how it can be facilitated. A users needs factors into the overall goal of the client as well. When DriverPass sets the goal of helping students pass their driving tests, all of the processes and features are going to contribute to that goal.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I personally prefer to start from the absolute basics of the software's requirements. I like to take a methodical approach, tending to each step of the project in a priority established prior to starting. Planning is paramount, in order to ensure that all of the necessary concepts are understood fully by the entire group, so that when it comes time to build and deliever, the client receives a solid and operational application. The system's requirements should be maintained throughout the building process and after deployment.
